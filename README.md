# CCR Metadata API for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) <!-- omit in toc -->

Use this repo to make an API for serving metadata about your tokens ([ERC-721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) or [ERC-1155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md)) to marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) and other third parties.

Metadata for each token can include an image, animation, attributes, scalar properties, boost properties, and more!
